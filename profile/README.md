## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This project contains the docker compose file for the entire system. 

To run our application locally, a docker desktop is required, alongside the docker-compose file from this repository: https://github.com/dls-electradrive/DockerCompose

The docker-compose file manages environment variables and installation of external and internal required applications

If docker desktop is installed, navigate to the folder containing the docker-compose file and write
`docker compose up`
To run our systems
